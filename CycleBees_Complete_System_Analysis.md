## Frontend – Mobile App (React Native + Expo)

### **What is React Native?**
React Native is a framework that lets you build mobile apps for both iPhone and Android using JavaScript. Instead of learning separate programming languages for each platform (Swift for iOS, Java/Kotlin for Android), you write one codebase that works on both platforms. Expo makes this even easier by providing pre-built tools and services.

### **App Structure and Organization**

```
mobile-app/
├── app/                    # Main screens (like pages in a website)
├── components/             # Reusable pieces (buttons, forms, cards)
├── config/                # Settings and configuration
├── constants/             # Fixed values (colors, fonts, sizes)
├── contexts/              # App-wide data sharing
├── hooks/                 # Custom functions for common tasks
└── utils/                 # Helper functions
```

#### **Main App Screens:**
- **`_layout.tsx`**: The foundation that wraps the entire app
- **`index.tsx`**: Entry point that checks if user is logged in
- **`login.tsx`**: User authentication (phone number + OTP verification)
- **`main.tsx`**: Main app container with bottom tab navigation
- **`home.tsx`**: Dashboard with promotional content and quick actions
- **`book-repair.tsx`**: Multi-step repair booking process
- **`book-rental.tsx`**: Bicycle browsing and rental booking
- **`my-requests.tsx`**: Track all repair and rental requests
- **`profile.tsx`**: User profile management and settings

### **How Navigation Works**

The app uses **Expo Router** which automatically creates navigation based on file names:
- Files in the `app/` folder become screens
- Folders create nested navigation
- Special files like `_layout.tsx` create layout wrappers

**Navigation Flow:**
1. App starts at `index.tsx` → checks if user has valid login token
2. If not logged in → redirect to `login.tsx`
3. If logged in → redirect to `main.tsx` (bottom tab navigation)
4. Users can navigate between 5 main tabs: Home, Repair, Rental, Requests, Profile

### **How User Authentication Works**

**Multi-Step Login Process:**
1. **Phone Entry**: User enters their phone number
2. **OTP Verification**: System sends SMS code via Twilio, user enters code
3. **Profile Setup**: New users complete their profile (name, email, address)
4. **Token Storage**: App receives JWT token and saves it securely on the phone

**Security Features:**
- JWT tokens stored in secure phone storage (AsyncStorage)
- Automatic token validation when app starts
- Token expires after set time for security
- Graceful logout and cleanup when needed

### **How Data Flows in the App**

**Basic Pattern:**
1. **User Action** → User taps button or fills form
2. **Local Validation** → App checks if information is correct
3. **API Request** → App sends request to backend server
4. **Loading State** → App shows loading indicator
5. **Response Handling** → App receives response and updates screen
6. **State Update** → App remembers new information for future use

**Example - Booking a Repair:**
1. User selects services → App calculates total price locally
2. User fills details → App validates required fields
3. User uploads photos → App uploads directly to AWS S3
4. User submits → App sends booking request to backend
5. Success → App navigates to confirmation screen

### **Key App Features**

#### **Home Screen:**
- Personalized greeting with user's name
- Rotating promotional cards (auto-scrolling carousel)
- Quick action buttons for main features
- Contact support button
- Pull-to-refresh for updated content

#### **Repair Booking (3-Step Process):**
1. **Services**: Select repair services with prices, search/filter by categories
2. **Details**: Contact info, address, preferred date/time, photo/video upload
3. **Summary**: Review booking, choose payment method, confirm

#### **Rental Booking:**
- Browse bicycle catalog with photos and specifications
- Select rental duration (daily/weekly rates)
- Enter delivery address and special instructions
- Calculate total with delivery charges
- Payment and confirmation

#### **My Requests:**
- Tabbed view for Repair and Rental requests
- Color-coded status indicators
- Expandable cards showing full request details
- Image/video viewing for repair requests
- Real-time status updates

#### **Profile Management:**
- Edit personal information
- Change app theme (light/dark/system)
- View account details
- Logout functionality

### **How State is Managed**

The app uses **React's built-in state management**:
- **Local State**: Each screen manages its own data
- **Context API**: Shared data like user info and theme preferences
- **AsyncStorage**: Permanent storage for login tokens and settings
- **No Global State Library**: Keeps the app simple and fast

### **Theme and Design System**

**Theme Management:**
- Support for Light, Dark, and System themes
- User preference saved and remembered
- Instant theme switching throughout the app
- Consistent colors and styling across all screens

**Design Principles:**
- 8px spacing system for consistent layouts
- Semantic color naming (primary, secondary, background, text)
- Platform-specific adjustments (iOS vs Android)
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes

### **How API Calls Work**

**API Configuration:**
- Development: Uses your computer's IP address for testing
- Production: Uses deployed server URL
- Automatic switching based on environment

**Request Pattern:**
```javascript
// 1. Get user's login token
const token = await AsyncStorage.getItem('userToken');

// 2. Make request with authentication
const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/repair/services`, {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});

// 3. Handle response
const data = await response.json();
if (response.ok) {
  // Success - update UI
} else {
  // Error - show error message
}
```

### **File Upload System**

**How Photo/Video Uploads Work:**
1. User selects media from gallery or camera
2. App validates file type and size
3. App requests upload permission from backend
4. Backend provides secure upload link to AWS S3
5. App uploads directly to S3 (not through backend)
6. App confirms upload success with backend
7. Backend saves file reference in database

**Security Features:**
- File type validation (only images and videos)
- Size limits (5MB images, 100MB videos)
- Secure upload links that expire after 1 hour
- No sensitive files stored on phone permanently

## Frontend – Admin Dashboard (React + TypeScript)

### **What is React for Web?**
React is a JavaScript library for building websites that update dynamically without needing to refresh the page. Unlike mobile apps, this runs in web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and is designed for desktop and laptop use. TypeScript adds type checking to prevent common programming errors.

### **Dashboard Structure**

## Backend – Express.js

### **What is Express.js?**
Express.js is like a traffic controller for web requests. When the mobile app or admin dashboard wants something (data, file upload, user login), Express receives the request, processes it, talks to the database if needed, and sends back a response. Think of it as the bridge between the front-end apps and the database.

### **Backend Organization**

```
backend/
├── server.js               # Main server startup file
├── middleware/
│   └── auth.js            # Security and user verification
├── routes/                # Different URL endpoints
│   ├── auth.js            # User login and registration

│   ├── contact.js         # Contact settings
│   └── promotional.js     # Marketing content
├── database/
│   ├── supabase-connection.js  # Database connection
│   └── supabase-schema.sql     # Database structure
└── utils/                 # Helper functions
    ├── s3bucket.js        # File storage (AWS S3)
    ├── twilio.js          # SMS messaging
    └── constants.js       # Fixed values
```

### **How Requests Flow Through the Backend**

**Basic Request Journey:**
1. **Request Arrives**: Mobile app or dashboard sends request to specific URL
2. **Rate Limiting**: Server checks if user is making too many requests
3. **Authentication**: Server verifies user is logged in (if required)
4. **Validation**: Server checks if sent data is in correct format
5. **Route Handler**: Specific function processes the business logic
6. **Database Query**: Fetch or update information in database (if needed)
7. **Response**: Server sends back results to the requesting application

**Example - Booking a Repair:**
```
Mobile App → POST /api/repair/requests/secure → Authentication Check → 
Validate Form Data → Save to Database → Upload Files to S3 → 
Send Confirmation → Return Success Response
```

### **Security and Protection**

#### **Rate Limiting (Preventing Spam):**
- **General API**: 50,000 requests per 15 minutes (very generous for mobile apps)
- **Authentication**: 1,000 requests per 15 minutes
- **OTP Requests**: 200 per 5 minutes per phone number
- **File Uploads**: 1,000 uploads per hour

#### **User Authentication:**
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure tokens that expire after a set time
- **Role-Based Access**: Different permissions for regular users vs admins
- **Token Verification**: Every protected request checks token validity

#### **Input Validation:**
- **express-validator**: Checks all incoming data is safe and correct
- **File Type Checking**: Only allows safe file types (images, videos)
- **Size Limits**: Prevents extremely large uploads
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Uses safe database queries

#### **General Security:**
- **CORS**: Controls which websites can access the API
- **Helmet**: Adds security headers
- **HTTPS**: Encrypted connections in production
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data (passwords, keys) stored securely

### **API Routes and What They Do**

#### **Authentication Routes (`/api/auth/`)**
- **`POST /send-otp`**: Send SMS verification code to phone number
- **`POST /verify-otp`**: Check if OTP is correct and log user in

### **Database Communication**

**How Backend Talks to Database:**
The backend uses **Supabase** (which runs PostgreSQL) as its database. Instead of writing raw SQL, it uses Supabase's JavaScript client which makes it easier and safer.

**Example Operations:**
```javascript
// Get all repair services
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('repair_services')
  .select('*')
  .eq('is_active', true);

// Create new repair request
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('repair_requests')
  .insert({
    user_id: userId,
    total_amount: amount,
    status: 'pending'
  });

// Update request status
const { error } = await supabase
  .from('repair_requests')
  .update({ status: 'approved' })
  .eq('id', requestId);
```

### **File Upload Handling**

**Two-Step Upload Process:**
1. **Get Permission**: App requests upload URL from backend
2. **Direct Upload**: App uploads file directly to AWS S3 (not through backend)

**Why This Approach:**
- **Faster**: Files go directly to S3, not through server
- **Scalable**: Server doesn't handle large file transfers
- **Secure**: Upload URLs expire after 1 hour
- **Efficient**: Reduces server bandwidth and processing

**File Security:**
- **Type Validation**: Only images and videos allowed
- **Size Limits**: 5MB for images, 100MB for videos
- **Virus Scanning**: Basic file content checking
- **Access Control**: Files only accessible to authorized users

### **Error Handling**

**How Errors Are Managed:**
- **Validation Errors**: Clear messages about what's wrong with submitted data
- **Authentication Errors**: Helpful messages about login issues
- **Database Errors**: Graceful handling of database problems
- **File Upload Errors**: Specific messages about file problems
- **Network Errors**: Timeout and connection issue handling

**Error Response Format:**
All errors follow the same format so apps can handle them consistently:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Clear explanation of what went wrong",
  "errors": ["Specific field errors if any"]
}
```

### **Third-Party Service Integration**

#### **Twilio (SMS):**
- Send OTP codes for user verification
- Handle SMS delivery failures
- Support international phone numbers (currently focuses on India)

#### **AWS S3 (File Storage):**
- Generate secure upload/download URLs
- Organize files by request type
- Automatic cleanup of old files

#### **Razorpay (Payments):**
- Create payment orders
- Verify payment signatures
- Handle payment success/failure
- Track payment status

### **Performance and Scalability**

**Caching Strategy:**
- **Static Data**: Services and time slots cached for 5 minutes
- **Promotional Content**: Cached for 10 minutes
- **User-Specific Data**: No caching to ensure freshness

**Database Optimization:**
- **Indexes**: Fast lookups on commonly searched fields
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connections
- **Query Optimization**: Fetch only needed data

**Monitoring:**
- **Request Logging**: Track API usage and performance
- **Error Logging**: Monitor system health
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse and ensure fair usage

## Database – PostgreSQL (Supabase)

### **What is PostgreSQL?**
PostgreSQL is like a digital filing cabinet that stores all your application's information in organized tables. Each table is like a spreadsheet with rows (individual records) and columns (types of information). PostgreSQL is very reliable and can handle complex relationships between different types of data.

**Supabase** is a service that runs PostgreSQL for you in the cloud, so you don't have to manage the database server yourself. It also provides additional tools like authentication and real-time features.

## Storage – AWS S3

### **What is AWS S3?**
AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) is like a massive, secure file cabinet in the cloud. Instead of storing files on your server's hard drive, S3 stores them in Amazon's data centers around the world. Each file gets a unique web address, so it can be accessed from anywhere.

**Why use S3 instead of storing files locally?**
- **Unlimited Storage**: Can store millions of files without running out of space
- **Global Access**: Files can be accessed quickly from anywhere in the world
- **Reliability**: Amazon backs up files automatically, so they never get lost
- **Scalability**: Handles everything from 1 file to billions of files
- **Security**: Advanced access controls and encryption

### **How S3 Integrates with CycleBees**

#### **File Types Stored:**
- **Repair Request Photos**: Customer photos of bicycle problems
- **Repair Request Videos**: Customer videos showing bicycle issues
- **Bicycle Catalog Photos**: Professional photos of rental bicycles
- **User Profile Photos**: Customer profile pictures
- **Promotional Images**: Marketing banners for mobile app

#### **File Organization Structure:**
```
cycleBees-bucket/
├── repair-requests/
│   ├── photos/
│   │   └── repair_photo_2024_01_15_abc123.jpg
│   └── videos/

```

### **File Upload Process**

#### **Traditional vs. CycleBees Approach:**

**Traditional (Slow) Method:**
Mobile App → Uploads to Backend Server → Server uploads to S3 → Success Response

**CycleBees (Fast) Method:**
Mobile App → Requests Upload Permission → Gets Direct S3 Link → Uploads Directly to S3

#### **Detailed Upload Flow:**

**Step 1: Request Upload Permission**
```
Mobile App → POST /api/repair/upload-urls
Backend → Generates secure S3 upload URL
Backend → Returns upload URL to mobile app
```

**Step 2: Direct Upload to S3**
```
Mobile App → Uses upload URL to send file directly to S3
S3 → Confirms successful upload
Mobile App → Receives confirmation
```

**Step 3: Confirm with Backend**
```
Mobile App → Tells backend "file uploaded successfully"
Backend → Saves file reference in database
Backend → Returns success confirmation
```

#### **Security Features of Upload Process:**

**Pre-signed URLs:**
- **Time Limited**: Upload links expire after 1 hour
- **Single Use**: Each link can only be used once
- **Specific File**: Link only works for the intended file type and size
- **No Server Load**: Backend doesn't handle large file transfers

**File Validation:**
- **Type Checking**: Only allows images (JPEG, PNG, GIF) and videos (MP4, AVI, MOV)
- **Size Limits**: 5MB maximum for images, 100MB maximum for videos
- **Content Verification**: Basic checks to ensure files aren't corrupted

### **File Access and Security**

#### **How Files are Retrieved:**

**Private Files (Repair Request Media):**
1. Mobile app requests file access
2. Backend verifies user owns the request
3. Backend generates temporary download URL (expires in 1 hour)
4. Mobile app uses URL to display/download file

**Public Files (Bicycle Catalog Photos):**
1. Files stored with public read access
2. Mobile app can directly access via permanent URL
3. No special permissions needed

#### **Security Layers:**

**Access Control:**
- **User Verification**: Only request owners can see their files
- **Admin Access**: Admins can access all files for support purposes
- **Temporary Links**: Download URLs expire to prevent unauthorized sharing

**File Privacy:**
- **No Direct Access**: Files cannot be accessed without proper authentication
- **Encrypted Storage**: All files encrypted at rest in S3
- **Secure Transfer**: All uploads/downloads use HTTPS encryption

### **File Management Operations**

#### **File Cleanup Process:**
```javascript
// When repair request is deleted
1. Find all files associated with request
2. Generate S3 delete requests for each file
3. Remove file references from database
4. Delete actual files from S3 bucket
5. Confirm cleanup completed
```

#### **Batch Operations:**
- **Multiple File Upload**: Handle several photos/videos at once
- **Bulk Delete**: Remove multiple files when cleaning up old requests
- **File Migration**: Move files between folders if needed

### **Performance Optimizations**

#### **Content Delivery:**
- **Global Distribution**: Files served from Amazon's global network
- **Caching**: Frequently accessed files cached closer to users
- **Compression**: Images automatically optimized for faster loading

#### **Mobile App Optimizations:**
- **Lazy Loading**: Files loaded only when needed
- **Progressive Loading**: Show low-quality preview while full image loads
- **Caching**: Downloaded files cached on phone to avoid re-downloading

### **Cost Management**

#### **Storage Efficiency:**
- **File Compression**: Images compressed before upload to reduce costs
- **Lifecycle Policies**: Old files automatically moved to cheaper storage
- **Cleanup Automation**: Orphaned files (not referenced in database) automatically deleted

#### **Transfer Optimization:**
- **Direct Uploads**: Reduces server bandwidth costs
- **Efficient Formats**: Use optimal file formats for different use cases
- **Smart Caching**: Reduce repeated downloads

### **Integration with Backend Code**

#### **S3 Configuration** (`backend/utils/s3bucket.js`):
```javascript
// Configure S3 client
const s3Client = new S3Client({
  region: process.env.AWS_REGION,
  credentials: {
    accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
    secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  }
});

// Generate upload URL
const generatePresignedUploadUrl = async (fileName, fileType) => {
  const command = new PutObjectCommand({
    Bucket: BUCKET_NAME,
    Key: fileName,
    ContentType: fileType,
  });
  
  return await getSignedUrl(s3Client, command, { expiresIn: 3600 }); // 1 hour
};
```

### **Error Handling and Recovery**

#### **Upload Failure Recovery:**
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for temporary network issues
- **Progress Tracking**: Resume interrupted uploads where they left off
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages with suggested actions

#### **File Corruption Prevention:**
- **Checksum Verification**: Verify file integrity after upload

## Messaging/OTP – Twilio

### **What is Twilio?**
Twilio is a cloud-based communication service that can send text messages (SMS) to phone numbers around the world. For CycleBees, we use Twilio specifically to send OTP (One-Time Password) verification codes to users' phones for secure login.

**Why SMS for Authentication?**
- **No Passwords**: Users don't need to remember complex passwords
- **More Secure**: OTP codes change every time and expire quickly
- **Universal**: Works on any phone, even basic phones without internet
- **Prevents Fake Accounts**: Requires a real phone number to register

### **How Twilio Integrates with CycleBees**

#### **Configuration Setup:**
```
Required Twilio Account Information:
- Account SID: Unique identifier for your Twilio account
- Auth Token: Password for your Twilio account
- Twilio Phone Number: The phone number Twilio uses to send messages
```

#### **Integration File** (`backend/utils/twilio.js`):
```javascript
// Initialize Twilio client
const twilioClient = twilio(ACCOUNT_SID, AUTH_TOKEN);

// Function to send SMS
const sendSMS = async (phoneNumber, message) => {
  await twilioClient.messages.create({
    body: message,
    from: TWILIO_NUMBER,        // Your Twilio phone number
    to: `+91${phoneNumber}`     // Add India country code
  });
};
```

### **Complete OTP Authentication Flow**

#### **Step 1: User Starts Login Process**
```
User opens mobile app → Enters phone number → Taps "Send OTP"
```
**What happens:**
- Mobile app validates phone number format (Indian format: 10 digits starting with 6-9)
- App sends request to backend: `POST /api/auth/send-otp`

#### **Step 2: Backend Generates and Sends OTP**
```
Backend receives request → Validates phone number → Generates random 6-digit code → 
Saves to database with expiration time → Sends via Twilio → Returns success
```

**Backend Process:**
1. **Validation**: Check if phone number format is correct
2. **Rate Limiting**: Ensure user isn't requesting too many OTPs (max 100 per 5 minutes)
3. **Code Generation**: Create random 6-digit number (123456)
4. **Database Storage**: Save OTP in `otp_codes` table with 5-minute expiration
5. **SMS Sending**: Use Twilio to send message: "Your CycleBees verification code is: 123456"
6. **Response**: Tell mobile app "OTP sent successfully"

#### **Step 3: User Receives and Enters OTP**
```
User receives SMS → Opens mobile app → Enters 6-digit code → Taps "Verify"
```

#### **Step 4: Backend Verifies OTP**
```
Backend receives OTP → Checks against database → Validates expiration → 
Creates/updates user account → Generates JWT token → Returns login success
```

**Verification Process:**
1. **Database Lookup**: Find OTP record for this phone number
2. **Code Matching**: Check if entered code matches stored code
3. **Expiration Check**: Ensure code hasn't expired (5 minutes max)
4. **Single Use**: Mark OTP as "used" to prevent reuse
5. **User Account**: Create new user account or update existing one
6. **JWT Token**: Generate login token for app authentication
7. **Cleanup**: Delete expired OTP records

### **Security Features**

#### **Time-Based Security:**
- **Short Expiration**: OTP codes expire after 5 minutes
- **Limited Window**: User must enter code quickly
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Old codes automatically deleted from database

#### **Usage Control:**
- **Single Use Only**: Each OTP can only be used once
- **Rate Limiting**: 
  - Max 100 OTP requests per phone number per 5 minutes
  - Max 500 verification attempts per phone number per 10 minutes
  - This prevents spam while allowing legitimate retries

#### **Code Generation Security:**
- **Random Generation**: Codes are completely random, not predictable
- **6-Digit Format**: Balance between security and user convenience
- **No Sequential Codes**: Never generate 123456, 111111, etc.

### **Error Handling and Recovery**

#### **SMS Delivery Issues:**
**Problem**: SMS not received by user
**Solutions**:
- **Resend Option**: User can request new OTP after 30 seconds
- **Alternative Contact**: Future feature could support email backup
- **Manual Verification**: Admin can manually verify users if needed

#### **Network Issues:**
**Problem**: Twilio service temporarily unavailable
**Solutions**:
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for temporary failures
- **Error Messages**: Clear user communication about delivery issues
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation with helpful error messages

#### **Invalid Phone Numbers:**
**Problem**: User enters wrong or invalid phone number
**Solutions**:
- **Format Validation**: Check phone number format before sending
- **Indian Format Only**: Currently supports only Indian phone numbers (+91)
- **Clear Error Messages**: Tell user exactly what format is expected

### **Cost and Usage Management**

#### **SMS Cost Optimization:**
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents accidental spam that would increase costs
- **Smart Resending**: Only allow resend after reasonable delay
- **Format Efficiency**: Keep SMS messages short to minimize character count

#### **Usage Monitoring:**
- **Delivery Tracking**: Monitor successful vs. failed SMS delivery
- **Cost Tracking**: Track SMS usage for business reporting
- **Abuse Prevention**: Detect and prevent malicious OTP requests

### **International Considerations**

#### **Current Implementation:**
- **India Focus**: Currently optimized for Indian phone numbers
- **+91 Country Code**: Automatically adds India country code
- **Local Format**: Expects 10-digit Indian mobile format

#### **Future Expansion:**
- **Multiple Countries**: Could support other country codes
- **Format Flexibility**: Dynamic phone number format validation
- **Regional SMS**: Use local SMS providers for better delivery rates

### **Integration with Mobile App**

#### **User Experience Flow:**
1. **Phone Entry Screen**: Clean, simple interface for entering phone number
2. **Loading State**: Show spinner while OTP is being sent
3. **Success Feedback**: Confirm SMS has been sent
4. **OTP Entry Screen**: 6-digit input field with timer countdown
5. **Resend Option**: Allow resend if OTP not received
6. **Error Handling**: Clear messages for common issues

#### **Technical Integration:**
```javascript
// Mobile app sends OTP request
const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/auth/send-otp`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ phone: phoneNumber })
});

// Handle response
if (response.ok) {
  // Show OTP entry screen
} else {
  // Show error message
}
```

### **Testing and Development**

## Payments – Razorpay

### **What is Razorpay?**
Razorpay is India's leading payment gateway that handles online payments for businesses. It supports all popular payment methods used in India: credit cards, debit cards, UPI (Google Pay, PhonePe), net banking, and digital wallets. Think of it like PayPal but specifically designed for Indian customers and payment preferences.

**Why Razorpay for CycleBees?**
- **Indian Market Focus**: Supports all popular Indian payment methods
- **UPI Integration**: Works with Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, etc.
- **Security**: PCI DSS compliant, bank-level security
- **Developer Friendly**: Good APIs and documentation
- **Reasonable Fees**: Competitive transaction charges

### **CycleBees Payment Strategy**

#### **Unique Payment Model:**
Unlike typical e-commerce where you pay the full amount upfront, CycleBees uses a **split payment model**:

- **Service Charge (Online)**: Fixed fee paid through Razorpay at booking time
- **Actual Repair Cost (Offline)**: Variable cost paid directly to mechanic after service

**Why This Approach?**
- **Commitment**: Service charge ensures customer is serious about booking
- **Flexibility**: Actual repair cost varies based on real problems found
- **Cash Flow**: Mechanics get paid directly for their work
- **Transparency**: Customers see exact costs after inspection

#### **Payment Flow Types:**

**Online Payment Flow:**
1. User books repair → Pays service charge online → Request confirmed immediately
2. Mechanic inspects bicycle → Quotes actual repair cost
3. Customer pays repair cost directly to mechanic in cash
4. Repair work completed

**Offline Payment Flow:**
1. User books repair → No online payment required
2. Admin reviews and approves request manually
3. Mechanic visits → Customer pays total amount (service charge + repair cost) in cash

### **Technical Integration Architecture**

#### **Challenge: Expo App Limitation**
Regular React Native apps can use Razorpay's native SDK, but Expo apps cannot use native modules directly. CycleBees solves this using a **WebView approach**.

#### **WebView-Based Payment Solution:**

**Frontend Implementation** (`mobile-app/app/components/RazorpayPayment.tsx`):
1. **Payment Modal**: Custom React Native modal with WebView
2. **Dynamic HTML**: Generate HTML page with embedded Razorpay checkout
3. **Real-time Communication**: Use WebView postMessage for status updates
4. **Payment Handling**: Capture success/failure and process accordingly

**HTML Generation Example:**
```html
<script src="https://checkout.razorpay.com/v1/checkout.js"></script>
<script>
const options = {
  key: "rzp_test_...",           // Razorpay key
  amount: 50000,                 // Amount in paise (₹500)
  currency: "INR",
  name: "CycleBees",
  description: "Service charge for repair",
  order_id: "order_123",
  handler: function(response) {
    // Send success to React Native
    window.ReactNativeWebView.postMessage(JSON.stringify({
      type: 'payment_success',
      data: response
    }));
  }
};
const rzp = new Razorpay(options);
rzp.open();
</script>
```

### **Backend Payment Processing**

#### **Payment Routes** (`backend/routes/payment.js`):

**Route 1: Create Payment Order** (`POST /api/payment/create-order`)
```
Purpose: Create Razorpay order before payment
Input: Amount, currency, request type (repair/rental)
Process: 
  1. Validate user authentication
  2. Convert amount to paise (multiply by 100)
  3. Create Razorpay order with metadata
  4. Store transaction record in database (status: pending)
  5. Return order details to frontend
Output: Order ID, payment key, transaction ID
```

**Route 2: Verify Payment** (`POST /api/payment/verify`)
```
Purpose: Verify payment signature after successful payment
Input: Razorpay payment ID, order ID, signature
Process:
  1. Find payment transaction in database
  2. Verify signature using HMAC-SHA256 encryption
  3. Confirm payment status with Razorpay API
  4. Update transaction status to 'completed'
  5. Return verification success
Output: Verified payment details
```

**Route 3: Payment Status** (`GET /api/payment/status/:order_id`)
```
Purpose: Check current payment status
Process: Lookup transaction by order ID and return current status
Output: Payment status and details
```

#### **Security: Payment Signature Verification**
```javascript
// Generate expected signature
const body = razorpay_order_id + "|" + razorpay_payment_id;
const expectedSignature = crypto
  .createHmac('sha256', RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET)
  .update(body)
  .digest('hex');

// Compare with received signature
if (expectedSignature === razorpay_signature) {
  // Payment is genuine
} else {
  // Payment verification failed - potential fraud
}
```

### **Database Integration**

#### **Payment Transactions Table:**
```sql
payment_transactions:
├── id (Primary Key)
├── request_type ('repair' or 'rental')
├── request_id (Links to repair_requests or rental_requests)
├── user_id (Links to users table)
├── amount (Payment amount in rupees)
├── payment_method ('online' or 'offline')
├── status ('pending', 'completed', 'failed')
├── razorpay_order_id (Razorpay order reference)
├── razorpay_payment_id (Razorpay payment reference)
├── razorpay_signature (Verification signature)
├── payment_details (JSON with additional Razorpay data)
└── created_at, updated_at (Timestamps)
```

#### **Payment Lifecycle in Database:**
1. **Order Creation**: Insert record with status 'pending'
2. **Payment Success**: Update with Razorpay IDs and status 'completed'

- Total Service Value: ₹530
```

**Step 2: Payment Confirmation Modal**
User sees clear breakdown:
- "You are paying service charge of ₹200 online"
- "Estimated repair cost of ₹330 will be paid to mechanic after service"
- "Service charge is non-refundable but applies to final bill"

**Step 3: Razorpay Payment Gateway**
```
Technical Flow:
1. Backend creates Razorpay order for ₹200
