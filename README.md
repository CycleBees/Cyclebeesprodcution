# Cycle-Bees

A modern bicycle repair and rental service application with offline-first architecture.

## 🚲 Project Overview

Cycle-Bees is a comprehensive platform that connects users with bicycle repair services and rental options. The application features:

- **User Mobile App**: React Native with Expo for booking repairs and rentals
- **Admin Dashboard**: React web application for managing requests and inventory
- **Backend API**: Express.js server with local database and mock services

## 🎨 Color Scheme

- Primary Yellow: `#FFD11E`
- Dark Blue: `#2D3E50`
- Light Yellow: `#FBE9A0`
- Cream: `#FFF5CC`
- Dark Brown: `#2F2500`
- Dark Green: `#2B2E00`
- Gray: `#4A4A4A`

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Offline-First MVP Approach
1. **Local Database**: PostgreSQL/SQLite with future Supabase migration
2. **Mock Services**: OTP generation, payment simulation, file storage
3. **Local Development**: All services run locally for testing
4. **Cloud Migration**: Easy transition to cloud services later
