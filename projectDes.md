Color Code For the app: FFD11E 2D3E50 FBE9A0 FFF5CC 2F2500 2B2E00 4A4A4A

Roles : User (the one using the App), Admin (the one managing everything)

Preferred tech: App for User (React Native with Expo App), Separate web-dashboard for Admin (React), and other tech stacks are mentioned here,

**Offline‐First MVP Prototype (TL;DR)**

1. **Local DB & Auth**
    - Run Postgres (or SQLite) locally with your future Supabase schema.
    - Use JWTs in Express (e.g. `jsonwebtoken`) and `bcrypt` for admin passwords.
2. **Express Backend with Mocks**
    - **OTP:** Generate/console‐log 6-digit codes in-memory instead of Twilio.
    - **Payments:** Fake a `/payments/mock` endpoint that triggers your webhook logic.
    - **Expiry Jobs:** Use `setTimeout` or `node-cron` for 15-min booking expirations.
3. **Local File Storage**
    - Accept uploads via `multer` into an `uploads/` folder and serve them with an authenticated static route.
4. **Front-Ends Pointing Locally**
    - **Expo React Native:** Set API base to `http://localhost:3000`.
    - **React Dashboard:** Hit the same local endpoints for CRUD and status flows.
5. **Swap to Cloud**
    - Replace mocks with **Supabase Auth/DB/Storage**, **Twilio Verify** and **Razorpay**, and deploy your Express app to Vercel/Heroku.

NOTE: For the first build i want you to setup the "online payment option" and keep place for later razer-pay integration, but for now, will only focus on

Step 1

since this version is fully offline based, so that all the things can be checkd and the whole thing can be built first, and then easily checked and then can connect to the cloud services for actual production, for now will do everything offline (any frontend or backend thigsn such as expo that requre internet can use internet, by offline i mean, no cloud servcies for now)

Step 2

Once Every Service is setup and configured, setup the database schema, create the database with proper relations, setup container, and do the other things as necessary

Step 3

Build the functionalities step by step

Major Functionalities:

        1. **Entry Point**: User opens app → sees phone number input
        2. **Phone Validation**: Enter 10-digit Indian mobile number
        3. **OTP Generation**: System sends OTP via SMS (6-digit, 5min expiry)
        4. **User Status Check**:
            - **Existing User**: OTP verification → logged in
            - **New User**: OTP verification → registration form
        
        **New User Registration Flow:**
        
        1. **OTP Verified** → Registration form appears
